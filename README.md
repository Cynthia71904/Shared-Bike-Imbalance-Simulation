# Shared-Bike-Imbalance-Simulation
This research project employs a system dynamics framework based on AnyLogic. The model captures how user behaviors jointly determine the dynamic distribution of bikes across three representative functional areas: Region A (high-frequency), Region B (medium-frequency), and Region C (low-frequency).
